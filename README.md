# push_swap

Push_swap is a project developed in C that implements sorting algorithms to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations. The objective is to sort the stack with the minimum number of operations. This project serves as an excellent exercise in algorithm optimization and understanding basic data structures such as stacks.

## Features

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implements efficient sorting algorithms to achieve the desired sorting with minimal operations.
- **Custom Operations**: Uses specific operations such as `sa`, `sb`, `ss`, `pa`, `pb`, `ra`, `rb`, `rr`, `rra`, `rrb`, and `rrr` to manipulate the stack.
- **Efficiency**: Focuses on minimizing the number of operations required to sort the stack.

## Requirements

- **C Compiler**: Ensure you have a C compiler like `gcc` installed.
- **Make**: The project uses a Makefile for building and managing the compilation process.

## Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/batuhankiskac/push_swap.git
cd push_swap
```

Build the project using Make:
```sh
make
```

## Usage

Run the program with a list of integers to sort:
```sh
./push_swap [list_of_integers]
```
Example:
```sh
./push_swap 4 67 3 87 23
```
